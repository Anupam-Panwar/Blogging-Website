        Chaos while Choosing the right wireframe Framework for you
      </h1>
      <i class="author">By Anupam Panwar</i>
      <hr />
      <p>
        One can easily get lost in the world of frameworks which moreover
        achieves the same result but the way to achieve that result is
        different. Same is applied while choosing wireframe Framework. The
        Internet is filled with many such frameworks like whimsical, figma,
        adobe XD, and many more and thus choosing the apt one for you can
        sometimes leave you in bewilderment. I was also in the same state when I
        got started with wireframe designing for my preparatory level-1. I
        explored various youtube videos and in the same fashion various blogs
        related to best wireframe Framework and more I searched about it more I
        was in bewilderment because this is the usual way one feels when he/she
        has incomplete knowledge about something. I searched continuously for 2
        hour about various features that these frameworks can offer me and with
        what ease I can achieve the desired result in these frameworks. At the
        end after exploring a dozen of youtube videos and half a dozen blogs I
        reached up to an conclusion that Figma could be the best choice for me
        because
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is a web based service so you donâ€™t need to download any particular
          app for designing. Any basic browser with an internet facility will
          work fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Real time collaboration like in canva is a feature that makes it handy
          for multiple designers to work on the designs at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Figma also provides a free plan to explore their platform which is
          sufficient enough to get your work done but if you are a college
          student then they are providing two year free subscription to their
          premium services so why not take advantage of the things that are
          explicitly made for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recently I came across a very fascinating feature of Figma that we can
          also show real time animation in our wireframe which makes it handy
          for the designer to explain his/her design to the client.
        </li>
      </ul>

       <i class="author"> -- Shakespeare </i>
      </p>
      <p>Similar is applied with Figma also. It too comes with some flaws</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As it is a web based service so sometimes it can frustrate you due to
          poor internet connection and if it happens during your presentation it
          is capable of ruining your complete day.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Here are some of the pros and cons of figma but a similar list of pros
        and cons can be prepared for any other framework also thus choosing an
        apt framework for you becomes a thing of subjective matter accepting the
        flaws in order to utilize the cons is the discretion of the Person. So
        choose your framework wisely.
