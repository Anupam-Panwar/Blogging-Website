      <hr />
      <p>Well,well,well! It’s time to stop ladies and gentleman.</p>
      <p>Time to stop using physical exfoliators.</p>
      <p>
        Physical exfoliators have been a buzz in the market for quite a while
        now,easily available,affordable pricing and oh that smooth skin that we
        get after using it,giving us the satisfactory feeling.Initially physical
        exfoliators made from ground of walnut shells were the best means to
        exfoliate.Then came the exfoliators with microbeads made up of plastic
        more soft and supple but a threat for the environment,causes a major
        marine pollution .Different countries are taking many steps to stop
        marine pollution.Recently The pacific nation of Palau banned suncream
        which contains oxybenzone as they are harmful to coral and sea life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than the environmental degradation the Physical exfoliators can be
        bad for your skin too and I will tell you what and why you should stop
        using them.They cause microtears which can further cause acne or
        irritation,these microtears are generally caused by irregular size of
        the scrub particles that are present there. And if you use Physical
        exfoliators regularly for a large period of time they may damage your
        skin barrier as well which is more harm than good. So,what are the
        options to remove these nasty blackheads?
      </p>
      <p>The answer is <strong>CHEMICAL EXFLOLIATION</strong></p>
      <p>
        2020 was the year of active ingredients for Indian market with so many
        Indian home grown brands coming out with products with
        AHA,BHA,PHA,Niacinaminde,Hyaluronic Acid,etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will discuss about Chemical Exfoliation in detail. Chemical
        Exfoliation are of three types:AHA,BHA,PHA.
      </p>
      <p>
        AHA are Alpha Hydroxy Acid made from sugary fruits.They are water
        soluble hence works on the topmost layer of skin making these acids
        suitable for the dry skin people. AHAs helps in hydrating the
        skin,brightening the skin and reducing the hyperpigmentation.AHAs are of
        many types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lactic Acid</li>
        <li>Glycolic Acid</li>
        <li>Mandelic Acid</li>
        <li>Citric Acid</li>
        <li>Tartaric Acid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BHA are Beta Hydroxy Acid.They are oil soluble hence goes deep down in
        the skin making it more suitable for people with oily and acne prone
        skin helps in reducing sebum production,enlarged pores(Size of Pores
        cannot decrease but BHAs clean the pores which makes it look as if size
        is redcued),hyperpigmentation,blackheads,Milia,etc.The most common BHAs
        found in the Skincare Industry is Salicylic Acid.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHA are Poly Hydroxy Acids.They are water soluble and work similar to
        AHAs only the difference is PHAs have bigger molecular size hence cannot
        go deep into the skin as AHAs and BHAs.PHAs are suitable for dry skin
        people, the people who cannot tolerate AHAs and who are just starting
        with chemical exfoliation.The most common PHAs available in the market
        are gluconolactone and lactobionic acid.They gently exfoliate the
        skin,help in strengthening the skin barrier,provide moisture and
        hydration to the skin and many more benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Chemical Exfoliation is good for skin and it helps skin in numerous
        ways but it might make your skin photosensitive that’s why it is always
        advised to wear sunscrean after Chemical Exfoliation. And your skin
        might purge when you start with Chemical Exfoliants but over a period of
        time it will make your skin healthy.
